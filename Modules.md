# Introduction #

SmoothOperator Modules allow you to install a full call center system with components from many software suites providing you a complete solution with minimum setup requirements.

# Details #

The way this is done is via the use of modules.  The system currently connects to a machine at VentureVoIP and reads a module list which provides the list of descriptions, creator etc.

The XML files that are downloaded contain everything you need to get the software working (at least in demo mode).

You can see more info on the format of the xml document here: [xmlformat](xmlformat.md)
