# Flash Operator Panel 2 #

We developed the first panel for Asterisk in 2004, and up until today is the most widely used operator console. Across the years we gained experience and we incorporated all this knowledge into version 2.

We've taken the panel a step beyond using Web 2.0 technologies to give you a polished web application for the Asterisk PBX. Using Adobe Flash for synchronous data gathering and Ajax for the User Interface.

At only $ 40 you get a superb panel that lets you monitor extensions, queues, meetme & trunks, with call notifications, visual phonebook, click to call, transfers, spy, etc. Or use the free version for up to 15 buttons
