SmoothTorque Predictive Dialler and Message Broadcaster



The purpose of SmoothTorque is to make calls. There are a few reasons you might want to do this:
Run an automated poll to check the spread of disease

Broadcast warning messages to potential tsunami victims

Keep your call centre busy

Host a message broadcasting service

Run large scale conferences where you want to dial out to participants

Why Choose SmoothTorque?

SmoothTorque predicts the future better
SmoothTorque is easier to use
SmoothTorque scales to any size
So, you're looking around and there are few choices in terms of products which appear to all provide the same features - some free, some not.

Why would you choose SmoothTorque? Well, it depends on what you're after. If you're looking for a predictive dialler (something to keep your call centre staff busy), then you'll really see the benefits of SmoothTorque over other solutions in the way that it predicts the future. If you're using SmoothTorque for Message Broadcasting, Polling or Emergency Warnings, then the benefit from SmoothTorque you'll see over other solutions is in it's ability to scale to unlimited channels and calls per second - a single SmoothTorque controller has been tested at 500 calls per second with the ability to use multiple controllers in larger settings.

First off, SmoothTorque uses incredibly advanced algorithms to predict what is going to happen in the future. Other systems just look at past data (if at all) and use this to say what will happen in the future.

SmoothTorque uses a large collection of algorithms (some based on fuzzy logic concepts and some entirely new) which mean that SmoothTorque is able to adapt to changing situations very rapidly.

Let's take an example - say you're calling people and it's the day of a major sporting event. No predictive engine is going to know that this is going to happen. So what happens is that the response rate to your campaigns suddenly drops off. SmoothTorque can quickly react to this and change it's dialling patterns immediately. Great, so your staff stay busy.

So, what happens at half time or at the end of the game? All of a sudden your response rate improves significantly - again SmoothTorque will recognize the change and update immediately.

SmoothTorque is also able to counter effects of rapid movements by preventing oscillation. In any system that reacts quickly to changes there is the potential for this. SmoothTorque however avoids it by introducing a concept of elasticity - this creates a situation where it is able to react to a potentially oscillatory situation by smoothing out the response.

Another area where SmoothTorque's algorithms really come into their own is when increases in speed aren't proving to be beneficial - SmoothTorque includes a built in "boost" system which will allow campaigns to have their rate temporarily increased in order to both maintain a good level of busy staff, and recover from a rapid disconnection of calls.

One other cool thing that SmoothTorque does is manage multiple campaigns using the same trunk when you have a situation where you really need more calls per second or channels than are provided. SmoothTorque distributes the available resources amongst campaigns in such a way that everyone will be able to continue to run, but with less capacity than they normally would have.

The final thing that really makes a difference when using SmoothTorque rather than a competing product is the simplicity of the interface - it really is simple to use - you can provide services to a call centre where the manager doesn't really know much about computers.

Of course if you're doing message broadcasting, polling or emergency warnings then the obvious benefit of SmoothTorque is that it can be scaled to whatever size you like - there is no limit to the number of calls per second or channels that a SmoothTorque system can utilize - seriously.
